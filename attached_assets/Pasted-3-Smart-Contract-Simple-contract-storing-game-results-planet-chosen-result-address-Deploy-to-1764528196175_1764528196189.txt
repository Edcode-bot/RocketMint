Simple contract storing game results (planet chosen, result, address).

Deploy to Celo Sepolia Testnet.

Store contract ABI + address and integrate into frontend.

Use composer kit MCP structure.

4. Gameplay Improvements

Implement the updated gameplay:

All planets visible at the top in a row.

Rocket sits on a Celo-painted launch platform (yellow accents).

When launched:

Rocket icon animates upward.

Leaves a smoke trail (CSS animation).

Lands on a RANDOM planet.


Planets glow/highlight when the rocket lands.

Game happens inside one responsive section (game container).

Make background animated (stars, galaxy movement).

Add subtle UI sound effects (optional).

Keep mobile-first layout.


6. Responsiveness

Game container should be responsive on phones (primary audience).

Make sure rocket + planets scale on smaller displays.

Use Tailwind or CSS to ensure fluid layout.

7. Deployability

Fix Vercel “download link” bug by ensuring:

Build scripts are correct.

Using Next.js (app router or pages router is fine).

Public folder includes favicon.


Replace Replit’s logo with a rocket favicon.

Ensure vercel.json is correct (if needed).



---

8. Codebase Stability

Remove unused components.

Fix TypeScript errors.

Optimize assets.

Make sure imports are valid.

Ensure components render without hydration issues.

9. UI Enhancements

Add floating Celo-yellow neon borders.

Keep UI modern, animated, and fun.

Keep colors Celo-themed: yellow, green, black.

Add subtle hover animations to buttons.
